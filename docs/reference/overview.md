# TN Framework Reference Guide

This reference guide provides comprehensive documentation for developing with the TN Framework. These guides are designed to be practical instruction manuals for developers and AI coding assistants.

## Framework Architecture

### [Package and Module System](packages-and-modules.md)
Complete guide to the framework's modular architecture:
- Package stack configuration and hierarchy
- Module creation and dependency management
- Class resolution and overriding patterns
- Best practices for organizing code

## Data Layer

### [Models - Basic Usage](models-basic.md)
Everything you need to create and work with persistent models:
- Creating model classes with proper attributes
- Property types and validation
- Database schema generation
- CRUD operations and searching

### [Models - Relationships](models-relationships.md)
Advanced model patterns for complex data structures:
- Parent-child relationships
- One-to-many and many-to-many associations
- Bidirectional relationship setup
- Performance optimization for relationships

## Component System

### [HTML Components](components-html.md)
Building interactive user interface components:
- Creating page components with full routing
- Template integration and best practices
- TypeScript and SCSS integration
- Component lifecycle and reloading

### [JSON Components](components-json.md)
API endpoints and form handling components:
- JSON response components
- Form validation and processing
- Error handling patterns
- Security considerations

### [Component Integration](components-integration.md)
Advanced component patterns and workflows:
- Parent-child component relationships

## Getting Started

If you're new to the TN Framework:

1. **Start with [Package and Module System](packages-and-modules.md)** to understand the overall architecture
2. **Read [Models - Basic Usage](models-basic.md)** to learn data persistence
3. **Follow [HTML Components](components-html.md)** to build your first UI component

## Reference Format

These guides are written to be:
- **Instruction-based**: Clear step-by-step processes
- **Example-heavy**: Real code examples from the framework
- **AI-friendly**: Structured for easy parsing by coding assistants
- **Complete**: All necessary attributes, patterns, and considerations

Each guide includes practical examples, common patterns, troubleshooting tips, and best practices used in production Footballguys code.
