<p>Wow. Thank you for purchasing a {$SITE_NAME} Gift Subscription. Let us be the first to say, you have EXCELLENT taste in gifts. Somebody is about to be super happy.</p>

<p>The gift subscription is on our {$planName} plan for {$billingCycleNumMonths} months, and we sent it to {$recipientEmail}.</p>

<p>You don't need to do a thing here.</p>

<p>We've sent the person you've gifted the subscription to a separate email (to {$recipientEmail}) with instructions on what they need to do in order to activate their gift subscription including a link they must click.</p>

<p>Just in case the person you gifted the subscription to has any trouble, here is a copy of the link we sent to them: <a href="{$BASE_URL}gift/activate/{$giftSubscriptionKey|urlencode}">{$BASE_URL}gift/activate/{$giftSubscriptionKey}</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again and thanks for being an awesome gift giver. The world needs more folks like you!</p>
